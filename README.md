# ADM-HW1-facchiano.1919922
First ADM Homework (PROBLEM 1 + PROBLEM 2 + PROBLEM 3).

For PROBLEM 1 and PROBLEM 2, I uploaded two files:
The first is made up of all the exercise codes (the exercises from PROBLEM 1 and the challenges from PROBLEM 2), put together in a single script, and it is called 'scripts_facchiano_1919922.py';
The second is also made up of all the exercise codes, but this time divided by cells to increase their comprehensibility: its name is 'scripts_facchiano_1919922_notebook.ipynb'.

I also uploaded a PDF file containing the screenshots of the submission page of HackerRank. The file is called "Problems_1and2_facchiano.pdf".


For PROBLEM 3 I uploaded a PDF file called "AWS_facchiano_1919922.pdf" containing the screesnhots attesting to completion of the AWS forms.
