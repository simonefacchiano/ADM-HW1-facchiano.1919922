# ADM-HW1-facchiano.1919922
First ADM Homework (PROBLEM 1 + PROBLEM 2 + PROBLEM 3).

For PROBLEM 1, I uploaded two files:
The first is made up of all the exercise codes (91 exercises, of which 89 100% correct), put together in a single script;
The second is also made up of all the exercise codes, but this time divided by cells to increase their comprehensibility.

Same thing for PROBLEM 2. I uploaded two files:
The first containing all the challenges in a single script;
The second divided in cells.

I also uploaded a PDF file containing the screenshots of the submission page of HackerRank

Finally, for PROBLEM 3 I uploaded a PDF file containing the screesnhots attesting to completion of the form.
